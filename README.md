## Chemometrics Basics
*Better Call Data: For All Your Chemometric Needs*
##

This repository contains educational examples for learning the basics of **chemometrics**. The materials cover key data analysis techniques using both Python and MATLAB. The tasks demonstrated here will help learners understand the fundamental concepts and applications in chemometrics.

## ðŸ“š Overview

The tasks performed in this repository include:

* **Data Loading and Processing**: Importing and preparing datasets for analysis.
* **Data Visualization**: Creating charts including radar charts, matrix plots, and Chernoff faces.
* **Cluster Analysis & Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Methods for reducing dimensionality and identifying patterns in data.
* **Decision Trees & Random Forests**: Supervised machine learning techniques for classification and regression tasks.

These tasks are performed using both **Python** (in Jupyter Notebooks) and **MATLAB**. The MATLAB-specific materials are described in the file **"Basics of chemometrics in MATLAB"**.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

* **`Basics of chemometrics in MATLAB`**: Description and instructions for the MATLAB-based course.
* **`DT&RF_lab.ipynb`**: Python notebook for Decision Trees and Random Forests analysis.
* **`PCA_instrukcja.ipynb`**: Python notebook for Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
* **`jezioro.m`**: MATLAB script for lake data analysis.
* **`jezioro.mat`**: MATLAB data file used in the analysis.
* **`kawa.m`**: MATLAB script for coffee-related data analysis.
* **`penguin.ipynb`**: Python notebook for a penguin dataset analysis.

## ðŸ”§ Usage

### Python Notebooks:

* Open the notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the analysis in Python.
* Follow the instructions in each notebook to load data, visualize results, and perform machine learning tasks.

### MATLAB Scripts:

* Open the `.m` files in MATLAB to run the MATLAB-specific tasks.
* The file **"Basics of chemometrics in MATLAB"** provides instructions on how to execute the MATLAB scripts and understand the output.
